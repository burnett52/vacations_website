                <p>
                    The purpose of this assignment is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of web
                    development while emphasizing the importance of user-friendly interface design. As part of the ISM
                    6225 course, the project tasks us with creating a static, data-driven website that combines
                    functionality, aesthetics, and interactivity. My theme, vacations, allows users to manage a wishlist
                    of dream destinations, offering a simple yet engaging way to explore and plan future trips.
                </p>

                    Beyond just building a website, this project focuses on mastering several key elements of web
                    development, including effective navigation, data visualization, and responsive design. By working
                    through these tasks, I am developing technical proficiency in modern web technologies while learning
                    to think critically about how design choices impact user experience. Additionally, this assignment
                    introduces deployment techniques, ensuring my work is accessible and properly managed using tools
                    like GitHub. Ultimately, this project has been an invaluable exercise in building real-world
                    technical skills that complement my business background, preparing me to create more impactful,
                    data-driven solutions in the future.

                <p>
                    While not all will be used for this assignment, or even this class, there are many exciting
                    technologies available to developers. I look forward to becoming more familiar with these
                    technological assets in the future. I am including a short list here for your consideration.
