                Welcome to my corner of the web! Here, I share my journey of exploration, learning, and growth as I
                navigate the intersection of technology, business, personal resilience—and my love for adventure through
                travel.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a BS in Entrepreneurship (cum laude) from the University of South Florida and currently pursuing a
                master's in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, I'm constantly pushing myself to explore new
                challenges and uncover creative solutions. For me, learning isn't just an academic exercise—it's a way
                of life, a path to growth, and a means to drive meaningful impact.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                What fuels my passion is the opportunity to make a difference, whether through innovative
                problem-solving, insightful analysis, or thoughtful collaboration. My approach is rooted in curiosity
                and a desire to bring fresh perspectives to every challenge. I value honesty, self-sufficiency, and
                excellence in all that I do, striving to exceed expectations and deliver value through my work.

                Before diving into the world of tech and business, I served as a combat medic in Afghanistan. That
                experience taught me the importance of staying calm under pressure, finding purpose in every task, and
                the incredible strength that comes from resilience. Recovering from a life-changing injury only
                reinforced my belief in the power of perseverance and the significance of purposeful work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of my professional life, I'm passionate about vacationing and travel. Exploring new places,
                immersing myself in different cultures, and stepping out of my comfort zone inspire my creativity and
                fuel my drive. Whether it's a quiet escape to a remote beach or an adventure-packed city exploration,
                travel reminds me of the beauty and diversity of our world and the importance of seeking out new
                experiences.

                This blog is where I bring it all together—tech insights, entrepreneurial lessons, reflections on
                resilience, and my adventures in travel. Whether you're here for tips on business strategy, reflections
                on personal growth, or stories from my latest journey, I hope you find something that resonates.

            <p>
                With a background rooted in business, my professional experience has largely revolved around areas like
                management, operations, and strategy. I've spent much of my career analyzing business challenges,
                optimizing processes, and driving organizational goals. However, venturing into the technical domain of
                web development through this project has been an entirely new journey for me.

                This assignment has provided me with the opportunity to work with foundational web technologies,
                including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which were all new to me at the start. Through HTML, I learned how
                to structure web pages effectively, while CSS allowed me to style them to be visually appealing and
                user-friendly. JavaScript was especially fascinating as it introduced me to the world of interactivity,
                enabling me to create dynamic web elements and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, I
                explored data visualization tools like Chart.js or D3.js to add meaningful insights to my website. This
                hands-on experience has helped me bridge the gap between my business expertise and technical skills,
                providing a broader perspective on how technology can drive business solutions.
